Ensemble means a group of something.In ML,Ensemble learning signifies a collection of multiple ML models.

Wisdom of the crowd:-How the crowd knows more than a single user.
Core Idea:-
training+prediction
We have a collection of ML model or an ensemble learning model.
We need to make sure that these models are different so that there is variety of field.
Variety may mean that these models are totally different from each other like one is SVM,other LR,etc.
Second way is that every model is LR model but while training these models we gave them different data.
Now a new point came,for which we need to predict.
The output of our ensemble model will be in favour of that result which will be in majority.This is about classification centric model.
In regression centric model,either the model will be different or the models will be trained on different data.Using different models,we will get different answers,and 
the final answer will be the mean of the data set obtained.
These all were about prediction.For training there are different ways,depending upon what the type of ensemble learning is.
